\part{Conclusion}
\section{Goals}
I set three targets when I started my internship; improve my skills in programme design, improve my time management skills, and improve my presentation skills.
    \subsection{Improve my skills in programme design} Most of my delivarables at Surewash involved code, which was predominantly Python. Having started with very little exposure to Python, I now feel confident reading and writing Python code. I have also gained experience with the soft skills of Python, such as what libraries are available, which means that I can now make a more informed decision as to what development path to take if I am given a new problem to solve using Python.

    As well as Python, I also produced deliverables in C, C sharp, and Java, which has improved my understanding of those languages.

    \subsection{Improve my time management skills} I improved my time-management skills by learning to use tools that can streamline my workflow.

    \subsection{Improve my presentation skills and public speaking skills} Given my experience at the start of my time at Surewash, I anticipated that I would continue to make presentations to my work colleagues, but this turned out not to be the case. I did improve my presentation skills however in documenting my work. Typically at the conclusion of a project, I would be asked to write a document describing how my solution works, both from a technical, and non-technical perspective.
