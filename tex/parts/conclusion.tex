\part{Conclusion}
\section{Goals}
I set three targets when I started my internship; improve my skills in programme design, improve my time management skills, and improve my presentation skills.
    \subsection{Improve my skills in programme design} Most of my deliverables at Surewash involved code, which was predominantly Python. Having started with very little exposure to Python, I now feel confident reading and writing Python code. I have also gained experience with the soft skills of Python, such as what libraries are available, which means that I can now make a more informed decision as to what development path to take if I am given a new problem to solve using Python.

    As well as Python, I also produced deliverables in C, C sharp, and Java, which has improved my understanding of those languages.

    \subsection{Improve my time management skills} I set this goal as I feel that it is an important skill to have, and not really something that I would have had to worry about while in university to the same extent that I would in a commercial environment. In a professional environment, the more time spent on a project, the more money it will cost. I think that I improved my time management skills by learning about how certain tools can be used to accelerate my workflow, these tools weren't core to my work, but they did make things easier. As an example, in the project on neural networks, I used an AWS server to train the neural network, since that was faster than doing it locally, but due to cost constraints, any extra data processing was still done on my own computer. The problem was that when I had finished preparing a dataset to train on the AWS server, it took a considerable amount of time just to upload the data, and there wasn't any other task that I could complete in the meantime, but using 7-Zip reduced the file size, and therefore the time spent uploading the file.

    \subsection{Improve my presentation skills and public speaking skills} Given my experience at the start of my time at Surewash, I anticipated that I would continue to make presentations to my work colleagues, but this turned out not to be the case, and therefore I didn't gain the experience I had hoped for in this. I did improve my presentation skills however in documenting my work. Typically at the conclusion of a project, I would be asked to write a document describing how my solution works, both from a technical, and non-technical perspective.

\section{Reflection}
I believe that this entire experience has been invaluable to me.
